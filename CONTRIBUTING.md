# Contributing to the Generalized Spallation Model

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Please note that there are several ways you can help contribute to the project, such as:
- Reporting an issue
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix via merge request
- Proposing new functionality or features
- Reviewing or updating documentation
- etc.

> We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## Contribution Workflow

This project primarily uses a GitHub flow contribution style. In short, all code changes to the main branch happen through pull requests. In summary, contributers will need to:
1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD-3 License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license](./LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.


## Report bugs using Github's [issues](./issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Please be detailed in bug reports. Provide background and sample code, if applicable. For example, try to include:
- A quick summary or background information
- Specific steps to reproduce the issue
- What behavior was expected
- What behavior occurred
- Relevant notes (such as why the behavior might be occurring, attempted workarounds, troubleshooting, or any combination thereof)


## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Please try to use a consistent coding style when contributing. Review existing code to get a feel for what that looks like. Typically, that includes:
* No implicit declarations
* Use *only* what's needed, nothing excess
* Use consistent spacing, and avoid tabs
* Choose clarity over compactness
* Try linting the project for style unification. This is an ongoing task.


## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under [the current license](LICENSE.md).
