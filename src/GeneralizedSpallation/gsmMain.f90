! ======================================================================
!
!    Final version for CEM03.03 release, AJS, LANL T-2, February, 2012.
!
!    INCOMPLETE LIST OF CHANGES:
!    1) Restricted asymmetric fission fragments to A >= 13 to prevent
!       a very rare problem.
!    2) Added Fermi breakup after each stage of the reaction to decay
!       any excited nuclei with A < 13 produced at the stage considered.
!    3) Replaced the RNDM generator with the RANG generator, which is
!       about 5 times faster because it can be compiled inline, and
!       has a period of about 2^63 ~ 10^19. See comments in the module
!       ranmc.f.
!    4) An early error derived wrong values for the a_f/a_n
!       multipliers found in the routine FITAFPA for the nucleus
!       181 Ta, which would affect fission cross sections for Z = 72 and
!       73. New values which now actually do reproduce the systematics
!       of Prokofiev are included in the routine.
!    5) Some fixes to the Fermi breakup were made by K. K. Gudima,
!       R. Prael of LANL, and S. G. Mashnik.
!    6) Integers are now explicitly typed as Real*4 or real*8 as needed.
!    7) Several other bug fixes.
!    8) Some additional clarifying comments were added to various SRs.
!
! ======================================================================
!    Various minor mods. were made; 2005-2009
! ======================================================================
!
!   October 7, 2005.
!
!   Incorporated several fixes to problems cropping up when Mokhov
!   runs a CEM03 event generator inside MARS in an MPP implementation of
!   MARS.  Also, some revised values of af/an for fission of Tungsten
!   isotopes were added to reflect recent data. AJS
!
! ======================================================================
!
!   February 14, 2005:
!
!   There have been several major changes introduced by Gudima and
!   Baznat, including redetermining af/an values for fission.
!     **** See 4) above ****                                  Mashnik
!   introduced Kalbach systematics for preequilibrium decay, some
!   improved angular distribution treatments for N-N and gamma-N
!   reactions and incorporation of systematics for gamma-A total cross
!   sections were implemented by Gudima and Mashnik. Sierk has
!   rewritten much of this later coding to vastly improve the execution
!   speed of the code, and also made some speedups in GEM2. Many
!   additional output options have been implemented. The important
!   improvements are discussed in the CEM03.01 Manual.
!
! ======================================================================
!
!   March 11, 2004.
!
!   THE CODE SHOULD BE COMPILED TO USE 8-BYTE INTEGERS!!!!!
!    ****  See 6) above ****
!   (Large simulations exhaust the range of 32-bit integers.)
!
!   Improvements made by A. J. Sierk, LANL T-16:
!
!   Edited various modules to have a consistent style (lower case,
!   indentation, etc.).
!   Corrected a number of logic errors and outright mistakes.
!   Fixed the photonuclear part of the cascade, which was incorrectly
!   implemented previously.
!   Removed calculation of several arrays from inside SIMULATEDECAY and put
!   the quantities in larger arrays to save time (ALJ and GB).
!   Broke up SIMULATEDECAY into a number of smaller and more manageable
!   pieces; (new) SIMULATEDECAY, PREQAUX, AUXL, PEQEMT, EQDECY.
!   Removed a large part of TYPEOUT into 2 separate subroutines PRTDIST
!   and PRTMULT to remove redundant code fragments.
!   Put in GAUSS2, a much more efficient gaussian-distributed random
!   number generator in place of GAUSSN, used by GEM2.
!   Enhanced the breakdown of emitted particles into those from
!   spallation, prefission, fission fragments, coalescence, etc.
!   Fixed the GSMOBJ%PRINTPARTPROP routine so it works properly for debugging the
!   preequilibrium, evaporation, and fission fragment production.
!   Converted many (all, I hope, except large tables in MOLLNIX, etc.)
!   constants to double precision.
!   Used the array a3rd to remove many calculations of A^1/3.
!   Put the reduced mass calculation into INITIAL to save time, also
!   ignoring the mass excess to remove the slight Z-dependence of
!   the reduced masses. **** THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED IN CEM03.03 ****
!   Fixed the calculation of statistics of the nuclei at various
!   stages of the collision. (See TYPEOUT, PRTMULT, PRTDIST)
!   Completely removed the iopt = 1 option, which gives the CEM95
!   version of the code.  This is obsolete and unuseable with the
!   modified GEM2 code modules.
!   Removed and/or commented some portions of unused code.
!   Replaced many INT statements with NINT where appropriate.
!   Removed all reference to file 14, the old cemxx.out file.
!   Replaced the Wapstra + Cameron calculations in the ENERGY function
!   by Wapstra and Moller-Nix, where MN are defined; use MNMACRO for
!   heavier nuclei outside the MN table, and Cameron (based on M(O16)
!   = 16.000!!) only for EXTREMELY neutron-rich isotopes of Z = 1-7.
!   Removed the request for the name of the input file; this is always
!   cem03.inp in the current version.
!   Switched to REAL*8 typing for more precision in variable typing.
!   Renamed the auxiliary ....tbl files to lower case.
!   Updated the constants in md in GITAB to be current with a newer
!   version of the Wapstra-Audi mass table.
!   Removed all EQUIVALENCE statements as a token move toward f90/f95.
!   Fixed the coalescence module; the trajectory separation was not
!   defined, so was always zero and the comparison to a radius
!   parameter was always satisfied. This leads to MUCH less coalescence.

!
! ======================================================================
!
!   Changes made by S. G. Mashnik, LANL T-16, 2000-2001 to get a
!        preliminary version of CEM2k:
!
!    1. Changed the method for transition from the CASCADE stage of a
!       reaction to the preequilibrium and the time of equilibration.
!       For incident energies above 150 Mev, the transition from the
!       cascade stage of a reaction to the preequiliblium is determined
!       comparing the energy of the cascade nucleons to a cutoff energy
!       of 1 MeV (still a parameter): all cascade nucleons with energies
!       less than 1 MeV above the Fermi surface are absorbed (as excitons),
!       to continue the following equilibration of the preequilibrium nucleus
!       and emit particles at the preequilibrium stage; the cascade nucleons
!       with higher energies are considered as cascade particles with
!       further interactions with intranuclear nucleons (spectators), if the
!       Pauli principle allows this.
!
!    2. At incident energies above 150 Mev, only transitions with Delta_n = +2
!       (in the direction of equilibration) are allowed at the preequilibrium
!       part of a reaction. This makes the preequilibrium stage shorter
!       and the evaporation stage longer, that in couple with 1) result in
!       a longer evaporation part of a reaction, with higher excitation
!       energy, and, as a result, more evaporated neutrons. Both points
!       1) and 2) were inspired by the recent GSI measurements (Phys. Rev.
!       Lett. 84 (2000) 5736): Incorporating 1) and 2) in CEM97 allows us
!       to describe well the GSI data, while without these modifications
!       we got with CEM97 too few neutrons and a bad agreement with the
!       data, just as we got with other 7 different codes we tested.
!
!    3. To be able to describe correctly backward emitted particles at
!       incident energies bellow 150, MeV we keep in CEM2k the "Proximity"
!       parameter, P=0.3, used previously in CEM97 and CEM95, and take into
!       account all transitions, Delta_n = +2, 0, and -2 at the
!       preequilibrium stage of a reaction. Some "physical" speculations
!       may be made about this (changing the time of the cascade and
!       preequilibrium stages of reactions with increasing the energy of the
!       bombarding particle), but we do not have now a good understanding of
!       how quantitatively and qualitatively different mechanisms of nuclear
!       reactions change with the bombarding energy, and the mentioned
!       changes here are of a more pragmati! type: to describe better all
!       the available data.
!
!    4. The real binding energies were incorporated for nucleons at the
!       cascade stage of reactions instead of the approximation of a constant
!       separation energy of 7 MeV used in previous versions of the CEM. This
!       required an additional routine, BindNUC, and improved significantly
!       the agreement with the data for some excitation functions, like
!       (p,n), (n,p), (p,2p), etc., where the threshold of reactions is
!       important and should be calculated accurately.
!
!    5. The momentum-energy conservation for the each cascade simulated
!       event was imposed using real masses of the projectile and target
!       and of emitted cascade particles and residual excited nucleus after
!       the cascade: The excitation energy of a residual nucleus is
!       redefined according to the momentum-energy conservation law, or
!       this cascade event is considered false and resimulated, if the
!       conservation law does not provide a positive excitation energy for
!       the simulated already emitted particles and residual nucleus.
!       A new routine, RENORM, was written for this, and included in CEM2k.
!       The last points 4) and 5) have solved the problem #1 in the list
!       of "deficients" written above in 1997 by A.J. Sierk, and allow to
!       get a better agreement with the data. Note, than the "deficient #6
!       of the mentioned list was solved in 1999 by A.J. Sierk: the present
!       version of the code is several times (up to 6-7, for heavy targets)
!       faster than the initial version of CEM97.
!
!    6. The reduced masses of particles were included in calculation particle
!       widths at preequilibrium and evaporation stages of a reaction instead
!       of using the approximation of no-recoil used in previous versions of
!       CEM. This point is especially important when calculating emission of
!       complex particles from light nuclei, and allowed to get a much better
!       agreement with the data for the yields of He4, He3, t, and d (gas
!       production) from light nuclei. But to solve completely the problem
!       of complex particle emission (gas production) from arbitrary targets,
!       better inverse cross sections have to be incorporated in CEM2k, as
!       mentioned above in "deficient" #2. We derived already our own
!       universal systematics for inverse cross sections of complex particles
!       and light fragments and plan to incorporate them in CEM2k in FY2002,
!       solving the "deficients" #2 and 4 from the above list.
!
!    7. To solve the problem of using reliable total reaction cross sections
!       (for the absolute normalization of calculated yields) at incident
!       energies bellow 100 Mev, we have incorporated into CEM2k the NASA
!       systematics by Tripathi et al. (niM b117 (1996) 347) for all incident
!       protons and neutrons with energies above the maximum in the reaction
!       cross section, and the Kalbach systematics (J. Phys. G: Nucl. Phys.,
!       24 (1998) 847) for neutrons of lower energies. All nucleon-induced
!       reaction results by CEM2k are now normalized to these reaction cross
!       sections (printed in the output file as "Used here inelastic cross
!       section"), while the old inelastic cross section calculated by the code
!       using the geometrical cross section and the numbers of inelastic and
!       elastic simulated events are printed nearby in the output file as
!       ("Monte Carlo inelastic cross section", so a renormalization of results
!       to the old cross section is possible as well. Note, that the new
!       normalization provides a much better agreement with practically all
!       available nucleon-induced reaction data.

!
!*******************************************************************
!
!   December, 1997
!
!   This program is a modified version of the code CEM95 written by
!   S. G. Mashnik.
!
!   Many of the historical options have been removed; so that only the
!   current best physics options are retained.  There are two basic
!   options:
!     1).  The CEM95 program as released by Mashnik in 1995; with its
!          preferred options for level densities (iljinov, et al.,#3,
!          1992), microscopic ground state corrections (Truran, Cameron,
!          and Hilf, 1970), and macroscopic fission barrier heights
!          (krappe, Nix, & Sierk, 1979). This version of the code
!          uses old-style nuclear masses (M(O-16) = 16.0000),
!          and the Cameron (1957) macroscopic energy calculation; it
!          also assumes all nucleon masses are 0.94 Gev, and all pion
!          masses are 0.14 GeV.
!          This version uses the new elementary N-N and pi-N
!          cross sections in the cascade, so is not identical to the
!          original CEM95; differences are small in the cases so far
!          checked.
!
!     2).  The partially upgraded 1997 version which includes the
!          mass tables of Moller, Nix, Myers, & Swiatecki, with
!          the corresponding shell corrections and pairing gaps,
!          the level densities as calculated by Sierk in 1996 to be
!          consistent with the Moller-Nix microscopic corrections using
!          identical methods to those of Iljinov, et al., new fits
!          to the elementary N-N and pi-N cross sections used in the
!          cascade portion of the model, actual free nucleon and pion
!          masses used in the cascade, and the Sierk (1986) angular
!          momentum dependnt macroscopic fission barriers, which are
!          consistent with the macroscopic model used in the Moller-
!          Nix mass calculations.
!
!    NOTE: This version still has many deficiencies which will be
!          addressed in the coming months.  This preliminary release
!          is being made because of the desire of the MCNPX team to
!          have a version of the code available.
!
!    Among the deficiencies are:
!
!     1).  The cascade does not conserve energy properly. The energy
!          of the Fermi surface is assumed to be -7.0 Mev, irrespective
!          of the actual nuclide. The excitation energy of the
!          residual nucleus after emission of a cascade particle is
!          not calculated with the actual ground state energy or
!          particle separation energy.
!
!     2).  The inverse cross sections used in the calculation of
!          preequilibrium and compound particle decay widths are not
!          a good representation of real cross sections.
!
!     3).  While calculating fission, the code does not have a model
!          for selecting fission fragments and following their
!          subsequent decay. When fission is a significant channel,
!          the emission of low energy nucleons will not be properly
!          modeled.
!
!     4).  The code does not have a model for fragmentation (emission
!          of particles heavier than alphas), either in the pre-
!          equilibrium or the compound decay parts of the code.
!
!     5).  Nuclei near the proton or neutron drip line are allowed to
!          to exist, although their particle decay will occur in much
!          less than the compound decay times implicitly assumed in
!          the model.
!
!     6).  No serious attempt has been made to improve the execution
!          speed of the code by analyzing where the majority of time
!          is being spent.
!
!     ....
!
! ======================================================================
!
! NOTE:   In the derivation of the level density parameters by Iljinov,
!         et al., pairing of 11.0/sqrt(A) was used, although the value
!         of 12.0 was stated in the paper.  This code uses 12.0, which
!         is inconsistent with the parameter sets.
!
!  Changes made at LANL, July-August 1995 (D. W. Muir):
!
!     1.  3 redundant variables removed (prinp:zapran,franz and partn:v)
!     2.  hollerith constants replaced with single-quote limited strings
!     3.  program card activated
!     4.  all Uc alphabetic characters outside of strings lowered.
!     5.  comments added to functions ranf1 and rndm to explain purpose
!     6.  save statement added to function ranf1 (not actually required)
!     7.  added cpu timing call and timing print
!     8.  most variables read from a single record for easier updating
!
!   Changes made by A. J. Sierk,  LANL  T-2, February-May, 1996; July-
!        December, 1997:
!
!    Moved program card to beginning of file.
!    Changed arithmetic if and go to (a,b,c...) statements to
!        if..then..else constructions; thereby removing many numbers
!        from statements.
!    Added indentation to if..then..else  and  do loops.
!    Inserted real and int functions to remove implicit typing where
!        noticed.
!    Explicitly open unit 15; cem97n.inp .
!    Change unit 16 to cem97n.info; for error and diagnostic messages.
!    Changed comment lines to be more easily readable.
!    Added extensive new comments.
!    Changed output formats to enhance readability.
!    Suppressed printout of descriptions of calculation after the
!        first energy; originally this was repeated for each energy
!        of the projectile.
!    Reduced maximum length of lines to 72 columns.
!    Arranged common blocks alphabetically in each subroutine.
!    Converted to generic Fortran implicit functions (alog -> log, etc.)
!   NOTE:  This RNDM was a different generator and has been discarded;
!   AJS  1/07/05.
!    Modified rndm to remove a problem with random numbers [rndm(i-1)]
!        greater than 0.999 . [The succeeding random number [rndm(i)]
!        was constrained to be in the neighborhood of 0.80, the spread
!        depending on the magnitude of 1.0 - rndm(i-1)].
!    Removed the ground-state shell correction calculation from bf,
!        putting it into a call to shell.
!    Changed the calling arguments to shell, to implement above^.
!    Added the parameter ipair, which allows selection between the
!        original approximate pairing gap of 12.0/sqrt(A) * chi and
!        the tabulated pairing gaps of Moller, Nix & Kratz (1997);
!        [Atomic Data Nucl. data Tables 66, #2 131-343].
!    Added the character variable heading(nh) to allow for printing a
!        descriptive text at the beginning of cem97n.res.
!    Added the Moller-Nix shell correction option to the ground-state
!        microscopic correction to the barrier height.
!    Put in tabulated (where available) or calculated (Moller-Nix)
!        mass excesses, in lieu of the formula in deltam.
!        For nuclei outside the table, use the macroscopic RLDM
!        formula from Moller, Nix, Myers, & Swiatecki.

!  ipar1,ipar2 = range of ejectile types for spectrum calcs.
!            See variables mspec, mang, mdubl.

!            used if mdubl=1.  Terminate with a negative tet1 value.
!  tmin(j),tmax(j),dt(j) = 4 energy regions and bin sizes (MeV).
!            used if mdubl>=1 or mspec>=1

!            gamma-N [Duarte approx for T <= 2 GeV; extrapolation
!            to avoid unphysical deviations in old approximations for
!            angles near 0 and pi for other energies.
